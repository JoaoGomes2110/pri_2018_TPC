      <h2>77. The Emissaries</h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>I swear by the emissary winds, sent one after another (for men's benefit),</li>
         
         <li>By the raging hurricanes,</li>
         
         <li>Which scatter clouds to their destined places,</li>
         
         <li>Then separate them one from another,</li>
         
         <li>Then I swear by the angels who bring down the revelation,</li>
         
         <li>To clear or to warn.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely what you are threatened with must come to pass.</li>
         
         <li>So when the stars are made to lose their light,</li>
         
         <li>And when the heaven is rent asunder,</li>
         
         <li>And when the mountains are carried away as dust,</li>
         
         <li>And when the apostles are gathered at their appointed time,</li>
         
         <li>To what day is the doom fixed?</li>
         
         <li>To the day of decision.</li>
         
         <li>And what will make you comprehend what the day of decision is?</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>Did We not destroy the former generations?</li>
         
         <li>Then did We follow them up with later ones.</li>
         
         <li>Even thus shall We deal with the guilty.</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>Did We not create you from contemptible water?</li>
         
         <li>Then We placed it in a secure resting-place,</li>
         
         <li>Till an appointed term,</li>
         
         <li>So We proportion it — how well are We at proportioning (things).</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>Have We not made the earth to draw together to itself,</li>
         
         <li>The living and the dead,</li>
         
         <li>And made therein lofty mountains, and given you to drink of sweet water?</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>Walk on to that which you called a lie.</li>
         
         <li>Walk on to the covering having three branches,</li>
         
         <li>Neither having the coolness of the shade nor availing against the flame.</li>
         
         <li>Surely it sends up sparks like palaces,</li>
         
         <li>As if they were tawny camels.</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>This is the day on which they shall not speak,</li>
         
         <li>And permission shall not be given to them so that they should offer excuses.</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>This is the day of decision: We have gathered you and those of yore.</li>
         
         <li>So if you have a plan, plan against Me (now).</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be amid shades and fountains,</li>
         
         <li>And fruits such as they desire.</li>
         
         <li>Eat and drink pleasantly because of what you did.</li>
         
         <li>Surely thus do We reward the doers of good.</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; surely you are guilty.</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>And where it is said to them: Bow down, they do not bow down.</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>In what announcement, then, after it, will they believe?</li>
