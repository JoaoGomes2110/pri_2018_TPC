      <h2>38. Suad</h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>Suad, I swear by the Quran, full of admonition.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation and opposition.</li>
         
         <li>How many did We destroy before them of the generations,</li>
         
         <li>And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves, and the
            disbelievers say: This IS an enchanter, a liar.
         </li>
         
         <li>What! makes he the gods a single God? A strange thing is this, to be sure!</li>
         
         <li>And the chief persons of them break forth, saying: Go and steadily adhere to your
            gods; this is most surely a thing sought after.
         </li>
         
         <li>We never heard of this in the former faith; this is nothing but a forgery:</li>
         
         <li>Has the reminder been revealed to him from among us? Nay! they are in doubt as to
            My
            reminder. Nay! they have not yet tasted My chastisement!
         </li>
         
         <li>Or is it that they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the
            great Giver?
         </li>
         
         <li>Or is it that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between
            them? Then let them ascend by any means.
         </li>
         
         <li>A host of deserters of the allies shall be here put to flight.</li>
         
         <li>The people of Nuh and Ad, and Firon, the lord of spikes, rejected (apostles) before
            them.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Samood and the people of Lut and the dwellers of the thicket; these were the
            parties.
         </li>
         
         <li>There was none of them but called the apostles liars, so just was My retribution.</li>
         
         <li>Nor do these await aught but a single cry, there being no delay in it.</li>
         
         <li>And they say: O our Lord! hasten on to us our portion before the day of
            reckoning.
         </li>
         
         <li>Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant Dawood, the possessor of
            power; surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah).
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely We made the mountains to sing the glory (of Allah) in unison with him at the
            evening and the sunrise,
         </li>
         
         <li>And the birds gathered together; all joined in singing with him.</li>
         
         <li>And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment.</li>
         
         <li>And has there come to you the story of the litigants, when they made an entry into
            the private chamber by ascending over the walls?
         </li>
         
         <li>When they entered in upon Dawood and he was frightened at them, they said: Fear not;
            two litigants, of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide
            between us with justice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the right way.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have a single ewe; but he
            said: Make it over to me, and he has prevailed against me in discourse.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own
            ewes; and most surely most of the partners act wrongfully towards one another, save
            those who believe and do good, and very few are they; and Dawood was sure that We
            had tried him, so he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and
            turned time after time (to Him).
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore We rectified for him this, and most surely he had a nearness to Us and an
            excellent resort.
         </li>
         
         <li>O Dawood! surely We have made you a ruler in the land; so judge between men with
            justice and do not follow desire, lest it should lead you astray from the path of
            Allah; (as for) those who go astray from the path of Allah, they shall surely have
            a
            severe punishment because they forgot the day of reckoning.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them in vain; that
            is the opinion of those who disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve on account
            of the fire.
         </li>
         
         <li>Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the mischief-makers in the earth?
            Or shall We make those who guard (against evil) like the wicked?
         </li>
         
         <li>(It is) a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good that they may ponder over
            its verses, and that those endowed with understanding may be mindful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We gave to Dawood Sulaiman, most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent
            in
            returning (to Allah).
         </li>
         
         <li>When there were brought to him in the evening (horses) still when standing, swift
            when running — 
         </li>
         
         <li>Then he said: Surely I preferred the good things to the remembrance of my Lord
            — until the sun set and time for Asr prayer was over, (he said):
         </li>
         
         <li>Bring them back to me; so he began to slash (their) legs and necks.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We tried Sulaiman, and We put on his throne a (mere) body, so he turned
            (to Allah).
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: My Lord! do Thou forgive me and grant me a kingdom which is not fit for
            (being inherited by) anyone after me;
         </li>
         
         <li>Then We made the wind subservient to him; it made his command to run gently wherever
            he desired,
         </li>
         
         <li>And the shaitans, every builder and diver,</li>
         
         <li>And others fettered in chains.</li>
         
         <li>This is Our free gift, therefore give freely or withhold, without reckoning.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort.</li>
         
         <li>And remember Our servant Ayyub, when he called upon his Lord: The Shaitan has
            afflicted me with toil and torment.
         </li>
         
         <li>Urge with your foot; here is a cool washing-place and a drink.</li>
         
         <li>And We gave him his family and the like of them with them, as a mercy from Us, and
            as
            a reminder to those possessed of understanding.
         </li>
         
         <li>And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with It and do not break your oath;
            surely We found him patient; most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent in
            returning (to Allah).
         </li>
         
         <li>And remember Our servants Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub, men of power and insight.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We purified them by a pure quality, the keeping in mind of the (final)
            abode.
         </li>
         
         <li>And most surely they were with Us, of the elect, the best.</li>
         
         <li>And remember Ismail and Al-Yasha and Zulkifl; and they were all of the best.</li>
         
         <li>This is a reminder; and most surely there is an excellent resort for those who guard
            (against evil),
         </li>
         
         <li>The gardens of perpetuity, the doors are opened for them.</li>
         
         <li>Reclining therein, calling therein for many fruits and drink.</li>
         
         <li>And with them shall be those restraining their eyes, equals in age.</li>
         
         <li>This is what you are promised for the day of reckoning.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely this is Our sustenance; it shall never come to an end;</li>
         
         <li>This (shall be so); and most surely there is an evil resort for the inordinate
            ones;
         </li>
         
         <li>Hell; they shall enter it, so evil is the resting-place.</li>
         
         <li>This (shall be so); so let them taste it, boiling and intensely cold (drink).</li>
         
         <li>And other (punishment) of the same kind — of various sorts.</li>
         
         <li>This is an army plunging in without consideration along with you; no welcome for
            them, surely they shall enter fire.
         </li>
         
         <li>They shall say: Nay! you — no welcome to you: you did proffer it to us, so evil
            is the resting-place.
         </li>
         
         <li>They shall say: Our Lord! whoever prepared it first for us, add Thou to him a double
            chastisement in the fire.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they shall say: What is the matter with us that we do not see men whom we used
            to
            count among the vicious?
         </li>
         
         <li>Was it that we (only) took them in scorn, or have our eyes (now) turned aside from
            them?
         </li>
         
         <li>That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the
            fire.
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: I am only a warner, and there is no god but Allah, the One, the Subduer (of
            all):
         </li>
         
         <li>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Mighty, the most
            Forgiving.
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: It is a message of importance,</li>
         
         <li>(And) you are turning aside from it:</li>
         
         <li>I had no knowledge of the exalted chiefs when they contended:</li>
         
         <li>Naught is revealed to me save that I am a plain warner.</li>
         
         <li>When your Lord said to the angels; Surely I am going to create a mortal from
            dust:
         </li>
         
         <li>So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down
            making obeisance to him.
         </li>
         
         <li>And the angels did obeisance, all of them,</li>
         
         <li>But not Iblis: he was proud and he was one of the unbelievers.</li>
         
         <li>He said: O Iblis! what prevented you that you should do obeisance to him whom I
            created with My two hands? Are you proud or are you of the exalted ones?
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: I am better than he; Thou hast created me of fire, and him Thou didst create
            of dust.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:</li>
         
         <li>And surely My curse is on you to the day of judgment.</li>
         
         <li>He said: My Lord! then respite me to the day that they are raised.</li>
         
         <li>He said: Surely you are of the respited ones,</li>
         
         <li>Till the period of the time made known.</li>
         
         <li>He said: Then by Thy Might I will surely make them live an evil life, all,</li>
         
         <li>Except Thy servants from among them, the purified ones.</li>
         
         <li>He said: The truth then is and the truth do I speak:</li>
         
         <li>That I will most certainly fill hell with you and with those among them who follow
            you, all.
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: I do not ask you for any reward for it; nor am I of those who affect:</li>
         
         <li>It is nothing but a reminder to the nations;</li>
         
         <li>And most certainly you will come to know about it after a time.</li>
