      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>Allah's commandment has come, therefore do not desire to hasten it; glory be to Him,
            and highly exalted be He above what they associate (with Him).
         </li>
         
         <li>He sends down the angels with the inspiration by His commandment on whom He pleases
            of His servants, saying: Give the warning that there is no god but Me, therefore be
            careful (of your duty) to Me.
         </li>
         
         <li>He created the heavens and the earth with the truth, highly exalted be He above what
            they associate (with Him).
         </li>
         
         <li>He created man from a small seed and lo! he is an open contender.</li>
         
         <li>And He created the cattle for you; you have in them warm clothing and (many)
            advantages, and of them do you eat.
         </li>
         
         <li>And there is beauty in them for you when you drive them back (to home), and when you
            send them forth (to pasture).
         </li>
         
         <li>And they carry your heavy loads to regions which you could not reach but with
            distress of the souls; most surely your Lord is Compassionate, Merciful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And (He made) horses and mules and asses that you might ride upon them and as an
            ornament; and He creates what you do not know.
         </li>
         
         <li>And upon Allah it rests to show the right way, and there are some deviating (ways);
            and if He please He would certainly guide you all aright.
         </li>
         
         <li>He it is Who sends down water from the cloud for you; it gives drink, and by it
            (grow) the trees upon which you pasture.
         </li>
         
         <li>He causes to grow for you thereby herbage, and the olives, and the palm trees, and
            the grapes, and of all the fruits; most surely there is a sign in this for a people
            who reflect.
         </li>
         
         <li>And He has made subservient for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon,
            and the stars are made subservient by His commandment; most surely there are signs
            in this for a people who ponder;
         </li>
         
         <li>And what He has created in the earth of varied hues most surely there is a sign in
            this for a people who are mindful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And He it is Who has made the sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it
            and bring forth from it ornaments which you wear, and you see the ships cleaving
            through it, and that you might seek of His bounty and that you may give thanks.
         </li>
         
         <li>And He has cast great mountains in the earth lest it might be convulsed with you,
            and
            rivers and roads that you may go aright,
         </li>
         
         <li>And landmarks; and by the stars they find the right way.</li>
         
         <li>Is He then Who creates like him who does not create? Do you not then mind?</li>
         
         <li>And if you would count Allah's favors, you will not be able to number them; most
            surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah knows what you conceal and what you do openly.</li>
         
         <li>And those whom they call on besides Allah have not created anything while they are
            themselves created;
         </li>
         
         <li>Dead (are they), not living, and they know not when they shall be raised.</li>
         
         <li>Your God is one God; so (as for) those who do not believe in the hereafter, their
            hearts are ignorant and they are proud.
         </li>
         
         <li>Truly Allah knows what they hide and what they manifest; surely He does not love the
            proud.
         </li>
         
         <li>And when it is said to them, what is it that your Lord has revealed? They say:
            Stories of the ancients;
         </li>
         
         <li>That they may bear their burdens entirely on the day of resurrection and also of the
            burdens of those whom they lead astray without knowledge; now surely evil is what
            they bear.
         </li>
         
         <li>Those before them did indeed devise plans, but Allah demolished their building from
            the foundations, so the roof fell down on them from above them, and the punishment
            came to them from whence they did not perceive.
         </li>
         
         <li>Then on the resurrection day He will bring them to disgrace and say: Where are the
            associates you gave Me, for whose sake you became hostile? Those who are given the
            knowledge will say: Surely the disgrace and the evil are this day upon the
            unbelievers:
         </li>
         
         <li>Those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust to themselves. Then would
            they offer submission: We used not to do any evil. Aye! surely Allah knows what you
            did.
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore enter the gates of hell, to abide therein; so certainly evil is the
            dwelling place of the proud.
         </li>
         
         <li>And it is said to those who guard (against evil): What is it that your Lord has
            revealed? They say, Good. For those who do good in this world is good, and certainly
            the abode of the hereafter is better; and certainly most excellent is the abode of
            those who guard (against evil);
         </li>
         
         <li>The gardens of perpetuity, they shall enter them, rivers flowing beneath them; they
            shall have in them what they please. Thus does Allah reward those who guard (against
            evil),
         </li>
         
         <li>Those whom the angels cause to die in a good state, saying: Peace be on you: enter
            the garden for what you did.
         </li>
         
         <li>They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them or that the
            commandment of your Lord should come to pass. Thus did those before them; and Allah
            was not unjust to them, but they were unjust to themselves.
         </li>
         
         <li>So the evil (consequences) of what they did shall afflict them and that which they
            mocked shall encompass them.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they who give associates (to Allah) say: If Allah had pleased, we would not have
            served anything besides Allah, (neither) we nor our fathers, nor would we have
            prohibited anything without (order from) Him. Thus did those before them; is then
            aught incumbent upon the apostles except a plain delivery (of the message)?
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We raised in every nation an apostle saying: Serve Allah and shun the
            Shaitan. So there were some of them whom Allah guided and there were others against
            whom error was due; therefore travel in the land, then see what was the end of the
            rejecters.
         </li>
         
         <li>If you desire for their guidance, yet surely Allah does not guide him who leads
            astray, nor shall they have any helpers.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they swear by Allah with the most energetic of their oaths: Allah will not raise
            up him who dies. Yea! it is a promise binding on Him, quite true, but most people
            do
            not know;
         </li>
         
         <li>So that He might make manifest to them that about which they differ, and that those
            who disbelieve might know that they were liars.
         </li>
         
         <li>Our word for a thing when We intend it, is only that We say to it, Be, and it is.</li>
         
         <li>And those who fly for Allah's sake after they are oppressed, We will most certainly
            give them a good abode in the world, and the reward of the hereafter is certainly
            much greater, did they but know;
         </li>
         
         <li>Those who are patient and on their Lord do they rely.</li>
         
         <li>And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation — so ask
            the followers of the Reminder if you do not know — 
         </li>
         
         <li>With clear arguments and scriptures; and We have revealed to you the Reminder that
            you may make clear to men what has been revealed to them, and that haply they may
            reflect.
         </li>
         
         <li>Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this) that Allah will not cause
            the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they
            do not perceive?
         </li>
         
         <li>Or that He may not seize them in the course of their journeys, then shall they not
            escape;
         </li>
         
         <li>Or that He may not seize them by causing them to suffer gradual loss, for your Lord
            is most surely Compassionate, Merciful.
         </li>
         
         <li>Do they not consider every thing that Allah has created? Its (very) shadows return
            from right and left, making obeisance to Allah while they are in utter
            abasement.
         </li>
         
         <li>And whatever creature that is in the heavens and that is in the earth makes obeisance
            to Allah (only), and the angels (too) and they do not show pride.
         </li>
         
         <li>They fear their Lord above them and do what they are commanded.</li>
         
         <li>And Allah has said: Take not two gods, He is only one God; so of Me alone should you
            be afraid.
         </li>
         
         <li>And whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His, and to Him should obedience be
            (rendered) constantly; will you then guard against other than (the punishment of)
            Allah?
         </li>
         
         <li>And whatever favor is (bestowed) on you it is from Allah; then when evil afflicts
            you, to Him do you cry for aid.
         </li>
         
         <li>Yet when He removes the evil from you, lo! a party of you associate others with their
            Lord;
         </li>
         
         <li>So that they be ungrateful for what We have given them; then enjoy yourselves; for
            soon will you know.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they set apart for what they do not know a portion of what We have given them.
            By
            Allah, you shall most certainly be questioned about that which you forged.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they ascribe daughters to Allah, glory be to Him; and for themselves (they would
            have) what they desire.
         </li>
         
         <li>And when a daughter is announced to one of them his face becomes black and he is full
            of wrath.
         </li>
         
         <li>He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that which is announced to
            him. Shall he keep it with disgrace or bury it (alive) in the dust? Now surely evil
            is what they judge.
         </li>
         
         <li>For those who do not believe in the hereafter is an evil attribute, and Allah's is
            the loftiest attribute; and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
         </li>
         
         <li>And if Allah had destroyed men for their iniquity, He would not leave on the earth
            a
            single creature, but He respites them till an appointed time; so when their doom
            will come they shall not be able to delay (it) an hour nor can they bring (it) on
            (before its time).
         </li>
         
         <li>And they ascribe to Allah what they (themselves) hate and their tongues relate the
            lie that they shall have the good; there is no avoiding it that for them is the fire
            and that they shall be sent before.
         </li>
         
         <li>By Allah, most certainly We sent (apostles) to nations before you, but the Shaitan
            made their deeds fair-seeming to them, so he is their guardian today, and they shall
            have a painful punishment.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We have not revealed to you the Book except that you may make clear to them that
            about which they differ, and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who
            believe.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah has sent down water from the cloud and therewith given life to the earth
            after its death; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who would
            listen.
         </li>
         
         <li>And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle; We give you to drink of what
            is in their bellies — from betwixt the feces and the blood — pure milk,
            easy and agreeable to swallow for those who drink.
         </li>
         
         <li>And of the fruits of the palms and the grapes — you obtain from them
            intoxication and goodly provision; most surely there is a sign in this for a people
            who ponder.
         </li>
         
         <li>And your Lord revealed to the bee saying: Make hives in the mountains and in the
            trees and in what they build:
         </li>
         
         <li>Then eat of all the fruits and walk in the ways of your Lord submissively. There
            comes forth from within it a beverage of many colours, in which there is healing for
            men; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who reflect.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah has created you, then He causes you to die, and of you is he who is brought
            back to the worst part of life, so that after having knowledge he does not know
            anything; surely Allah is Knowing, Powerful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah has made some of you excel others in the means of subsistence, so those
            who
            are made to excel do not give away their sustenance to those whom their right hands
            possess so that they should be equal therein; is it then the favor of Allah which
            they deny?
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah has made wives for you from among yourselves, and has given you sons and
            grandchildren from your wives, and has given you of the good things; is it then in
            the falsehood that they believe while it is in the favor of Allah that they
            disbelieve?
         </li>
         
         <li>And they serve besides Allah that which does not control for them any sustenance at
            all from the heavens and the earth, nor have they any power.
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore do not give likenesses to Allah; surely Allah knows and you do not
            know.
         </li>
         
         <li>Allah sets forth a parable: (consider) a slave, the property of another, (who) has
            no
            power over anything, and one whom We have granted from Ourselves a goodly sustenance
            so he spends from it secretly and openly; are the two alike? (All) praise is due to
            Allah! Nay, most of them do not know.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah sets forth a parable of two men; one of them is dumb, not able to do
            anything, and he is a burden to his master; wherever he sends him, he brings no
            good; can he be held equal with him who enjoins what is just, and he (himself) is
            on
            the right path?
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah's is the unseen of the heavens and the earth; and the matter of the hour
            is
            but as the twinkling of an eye or it is higher still; surely Allah has power over
            all things.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah has brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers — you did not
            know anything — and He gave you hearing and sight and hearts that you may give
            thanks.
         </li>
         
         <li>Do they not see the birds, constrained in the middle of the sky? None withholds them
            but Allah; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah has given you a place to abide in your houses, and He has given you tents
            of the skins of cattle which you find light to carry on the day of your march and
            on
            the day of your halting, and of their wool and their fur and their hair (He has
            given you) household stuff and a provision for a time.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah has made for you of what He has created shelters, and He has given you in
            the mountains places of retreat, and He has given you garments to preserve you from
            the heat and coats of mail to preserve you in your fighting; even thus does He
            complete His favor upon you, that haply you may submit.
         </li>
         
         <li>But if they turn back, then on you devolves only the clear deliverance (of the
            message).
         </li>
         
         <li>They recognize the favor of Allah, yet they deny it, and most of them are
            ungrateful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And on the day when We will raise up a witness out of every nation, then shall no
            permission be given to those who disbelieve, nor shall they be made to solicit
            favor.
         </li>
         
         <li>And when those who are unjust shall see the chastisement, it shall not be lightened
            for them, nor shall they be respited. .
         </li>
         
         <li>And when those who associate (others with Allah) shall see their associate-gods, they
            shall say: Our Lord, these are our associate-gods on whom we called besides Thee.
            But they will give them back the reply: Most surely you are liars.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they shall tender submission to Allah on that day; and what they used to forge
            shall depart from them.
         </li>
         
         <li>(As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way, We will add
            chastisement to their chastisement because they made mischief.
         </li>
         
         <li>And on the day when We will raise up in every people a witness against them from
            among themselves, and bring you as a witness against these — and We have
            revealed the Book to you explaining clearly everything, and a guidance and mercy and
            good news for those who submit.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely Allah enjoins the doing of justice and the doing of good (to others) and the
            giving to the kindred, and He forbids indecency and evil and rebellion; He
            admonishes you that you may be mindful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have made a covenant, and do not break
            the
            oaths after making them fast, and you have indeed made Allah a surety for you;
            surely Allah I . knows what you do.
         </li>
         
         <li>And be not like her who unravels her yarn, disintegrating it into pieces after she
            has spun it strongly. You make your oaths to be means of deceit between you because
            (one) nation is more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only tries you by this;
            and He will most certainly make clear to you on the resurrection day that about
            which you differed.
         </li>
         
         <li>And if Allah please He would certainly make you a single nation, but He causes to
            err
            whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases; and most certainly you will be
            questioned as to what you did.
         </li>
         
         <li>And do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you, lest a foot should slip
            after its stability and you should taste evil because you turned away from Allah's
            way and grievous punishment be your (lot).
         </li>
         
         <li>And do not take a small price in exchange for Allah's covenant; surely what is with
            Allah is better for you, did you but know.
         </li>
         
         <li>What is with you passes away and what is with Allah is enduring; and We will most
            certainly give to those who are patient their reward for the best of what they
            did.
         </li>
         
         <li>Whoever does good whether male or female and he is a believer, We will most certainly
            make him live a happy life, and We will most certainly give them their reward for
            the best of what they did.
         </li>
         
         <li>So when you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaitan,</li>
         
         <li>Surely he has no authority over those who believe and rely on their Lord.</li>
         
         <li>His authority is only over those who befriend him and those who associate others with
            Him.
         </li>
         
         <li>And when We change (one) communication for (another) communication, and Allah knows
            best what He reveals, they say: You are only a forger. Nay, most of them do not
            know.
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: The Holy spirit has revealed it from your Lord with the truth, that it may
            establish those who believe and as a guidance and good news for those who
            submit.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We know that they say: Only a mortal teaches him. The tongue of him
            whom they reproach is barbarous, and this is clear Arabic tongue.
         </li>
         
         <li>(As for) those who do not believe in Allah's communications, surely Allah will not
            guide them, and they shall have a painful punishment.
         </li>
         
         <li>Only they forge the lie who do not believe in Allah's communications, and these are
            the liars.
         </li>
         
         <li>He who disbelieves in Allah after his having believed, not he who is compelled while
            his heart is at rest on account of faith, but he who opens (his) breast to disbelief
            — on these is the wrath of Allah, and they shall have a grievous
            chastisement.
         </li>
         
         <li>This is because they love this world's life more than the hereafter, and because
            Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.
         </li>
         
         <li>These are they on whose hearts and their hearing and their eyes Allah has set a seal,
            and these are the heedless ones.
         </li>
         
         <li>No doubt that in the hereafter they will be the losers.</li>
         
         <li>Yet surely your Lord, with respect to those who fly after they are persecuted, then
            they struggle hard and are patient, most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving,
            Merciful.
         </li>
         
         <li>(Remember) the day when every soul shall come, pleading for itself and every soul
            shall be paid in full what it has done, and they shall not be dealt with
            unjustly.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Allah sets forth a parable: (Consider) a town safe and secure to which its means
            of subsistence come in abundance from every quarter; but it became ungrateful to
            Allah's favors, therefore Allah made it to taste the utmost degree of hunger and
            fear because of what they wrought.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly there came to them an Apostle from among them, but they rejected him,
            so the punishment overtook them while they were unjust.
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore eat of what Allah has given you, lawful and good (things), and give thanks
            for Allah's favor if Him do you serve.
         </li>
         
         <li>He has only forbidden you what dies of itself and blood and flesh of swine and that
            over which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, but whoever is driven
            to necessity, not desiring nor exceeding the limit, then surely Allah is Forgiving,
            Merciful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And, for what your tongues describe, do not utter the lie, (saying) This is lawful
            and this is unlawful, in order to forge a lie against Allah; surely those who forge
            the lie against Allah shall not prosper.
         </li>
         
         <li>A little enjoyment and they shall have a painful punishment.</li>
         
         <li>And for those who were Jews We prohibited what We have related to you already, and
            We
            did them no injustice, but they were unjust to themselves.
         </li>
         
         <li>Yet surely your Lord, with respect to those who do an evil in ignorance, then turn
            after that and make amends, most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving,
            Merciful.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely Ibrahim was an exemplar, obedient to Allah, upright, and he was not of the
            polytheists.
         </li>
         
         <li>Grateful for His favors; He chose him and guided him on the right path.</li>
         
         <li>And We gave him good in this world, and in the next he will most surely be among the
            good.
         </li>
         
         <li>Then We revealed to you: Follow the faith of Ibrahim, the upright one, and he was
            not
            of the polytheists.
         </li>
         
         <li>The Sabbath was ordained only for those who differed about it, and most surely your
            Lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that about which
            they differed.
         </li>
         
         <li>Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and have
            disputations with them in the best manner; surely your Lord best knows those who go
            astray from His path, and He knows best those who follow the right way.
         </li>
         
         <li>And if you take your turn, then retaliate with the like of that with which you were
            afflicted; but if you are patient, it will certainly be best for those who are
            patient.
         </li>
         
         <li>And be patient and your patience is not but by (the assistance of) Allah, and grieve
            not for them, and do not distress yourself at what they plan.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely Allah is with those who guard (against evil) and those who do good (to
            others).
         </li>
