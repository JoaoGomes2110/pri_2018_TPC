      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>I swear by the wind that scatters far and wide,</li>
         
         <li>Then those clouds bearing the load (of minute things in space).</li>
         
         <li>Then those (ships) that glide easily,</li>
         
         <li>Then those (angels who) distribute blessings by Our command;</li>
         
         <li>What you are threatened with is most surely true,</li>
         
         <li>And the judgment must most surely come about.</li>
         
         <li>I swear by the heaven full of ways.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely you are at variance with each other in what you say,</li>
         
         <li>He is turned away from it who would be turned away.</li>
         
         <li>Cursed be the liars,</li>
         
         <li>Who are in a gulf (of ignorance) neglectful;</li>
         
         <li>They ask: When is the day of judgment?</li>
         
         <li>(It is) the day on which they shall be tried at the fire.</li>
         
         <li>Taste your persecution! this is what you would hasten on.</li>
         
         <li>Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in gardens and fountains.</li>
         
         <li>Taking what their Lord gives them; surely they were before that, the doers of
            good.
         </li>
         
         <li>They used to sleep but little in the night.</li>
         
         <li>And in the morning they asked forgiveness.</li>
         
         <li>And in their property was a portion due to him who begs and to him who is denied
            (good).
         </li>
         
         <li>And in the earth there are signs for those who are sure,</li>
         
         <li>And in your own souls (too); will you not then see?</li>
         
         <li>And in the heaven is your sustenance and what you are threatened with.</li>
         
         <li>And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth! it is most surely the truth, just as
            you do speak.
         </li>
         
         <li>Has there come to you information about the honored guests of Ibrahim?</li>
         
         <li>When they entered upon him, they said: Peace. Peace, said he, a strange people.</li>
         
         <li>Then he turned aside to his family secretly and brought a fat (roasted) calf,</li>
         
         <li>So he brought it near them. He said: What! will you not eat?</li>
         
         <li>So he conceived in his mind a fear on account of them. They said: Fear not. And they
            gave him the good news of a boy possessing knowledge.
         </li>
         
         <li>Then his wife came up in great grief, and she struck her face and said: An old barren
            woman!
         </li>
         
         <li>They said: Thus says your Lord: Surely He is the Wise, the Knowing.</li>
         
         <li>He said: What is your affair then, O messengers!</li>
         
         <li>They said: Surely we are sent to a guilty people,</li>
         
         <li>That we may send down upon them stone of clay,</li>
         
         <li>Sent forth from your Lord for the extravagant.</li>
         
         <li>Then We brought forth such as were therein of the believers.</li>
         
         <li>But We did not find therein save a (single) house of those who submitted (the
            Muslims).
         </li>
         
         <li>And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment.</li>
         
         <li>And in Musa: When We sent him to Firon with clear authority.</li>
         
         <li>But he turned away with his forces and said: A magician or a mad man.</li>
         
         <li>So We seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the sea and he was blamable.</li>
         
         <li>And in Ad: When We sent upon them the destructive wind.</li>
         
         <li>It did not leave aught on which it blew, but it made it like ashes.</li>
         
         <li>And in Samood: When it was said to them: Enjoy yourselves for a while.</li>
         
         <li>But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord, so the rumbling overtook
            them while they saw.
         </li>
         
         <li>So they were not able to rise up, nor could they defend themselves;</li>
         
         <li>And the people of Nuh before, surely they were a transgressing people.</li>
         
         <li>And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and most surely We are the makers of
            things ample.
         </li>
         
         <li>And the earth, We have made it a wide extent; how well have We then spread (it)
            out.
         </li>
         
         <li>And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore fly to Allah, surely I am a plain warner to you from Him.</li>
         
         <li>And do not set up with Allah another god: surely I am a plain warner to you from
            Him.
         </li>
         
         <li>Thus there did not come to those before them an apostle but they said: A magician
            or
            a mad man.
         </li>
         
         <li>Have they charged each other with this? Nay! they are an inordinate people.</li>
         
         <li>Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame;</li>
         
         <li>And continue to remind, for surely the reminder profits the believers.</li>
         
         <li>And I have not created the jinn and the men except that they should serve Me.</li>
         
         <li>I do not desire from them any sustenance and I do not desire that they should feed
            Me.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely Allah is the Bestower of sustenance, the Lord of Power, the Strong.</li>
         
         <li>So surely those who are unjust shall have a portion like the portion of their
            companions, therefore let them not ask Me to hasten on.
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore woe to those who disbelieve because of their day which they are threatened
            with.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
