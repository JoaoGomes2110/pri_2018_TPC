      <h2>75. The Resurrection</h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>Nay! I swear by the day of resurrection.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! I swear by the self-accusing soul.</li>
         
         <li>Does man think that We shall not gather his bones?</li>
         
         <li>Yea! We are able to make complete his very fingertips,</li>
         
         <li>Nay! man desires to give the lie to what is before him.</li>
         
         <li>He asks: When is the day of resurrection?</li>
         
         <li>So when the sight becomes dazed,</li>
         
         <li>And the moon becomes dark,</li>
         
         <li>And the sun and the moon are brought together,</li>
         
         <li>Man shall say on that day: Whither to fly to?</li>
         
         <li>By no means! there shall be no place of refuge!</li>
         
         <li>With your Lord alone shall on that day be the place of rest.</li>
         
         <li>Man shall on that day be informed of what he sent before and (what he) put off.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! man is evidence against himself,</li>
         
         <li>Though he puts forth his excuses.</li>
         
         <li>Do not move your tongue with it to make haste with it,</li>
         
         <li>Surely on Us (devolves) the collecting of it and the reciting of it.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore when We have recited it, follow its recitation.</li>
         
         <li>Again on Us (devolves) the explaining of it.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! But you love the present life,</li>
         
         <li>And neglect the hereafter.</li>
         
         <li>(Some) faces on that day shall be bright,</li>
         
         <li>Looking to their Lord.</li>
         
         <li>And (other) faces on that day shall be gloomy,</li>
         
         <li>Knowing that there will be made to befall them some great calamity.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! When it comes up to the throat,</li>
         
         <li>And it is said: Who will be a magician?</li>
         
         <li>And he is sure that it is the (hour of) parting,</li>
         
         <li>And affliction is combined with affliction;</li>
         
         <li>To your Lord on that day shall be the driving.</li>
         
         <li>So he did not accept the truth, nor did he pray,</li>
         
         <li>But called the truth a lie and turned back,</li>
         
         <li>Then he went to his followers, walking away in haughtiness.</li>
         
         <li>Nearer to you (is destruction) and nearer,</li>
         
         <li>Again (consider how) nearer to you and nearer.</li>
         
         <li>Does man think that he is to be left to wander without an aim?</li>
         
         <li>Was he not a small seed in the seminal elements,</li>
         
         <li>Then he was a clot of blood, so He created (him) then made (him) perfect.</li>
         
         <li>Then He made of him two kinds, the male and the female.</li>
         
         <li>Is not He able to give life to the dead?</li>
