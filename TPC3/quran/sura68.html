      <h2>68. The Pen</h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>Noon. I swear by the pen and what the angels write,</li>
         
         <li>By the grace of your Lord you are not mad.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely you shall have a reward never to be cut off.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely you conform (yourself) to sublime morality.</li>
         
         <li>So you shall see, and they (too) shall see,</li>
         
         <li>Which of you is afflicted with madness.</li>
         
         <li>Surely your Lord best knows him who errs from His way, and He best knows the
            followers of the right course.
         </li>
         
         <li>So do not yield to the rejecters.</li>
         
         <li>They wish that you should be pliant so they (too) would be pliant.</li>
         
         <li>And yield not to any mean swearer,</li>
         
         <li>Defamer, going about with slander,</li>
         
         <li>Forbidder of good, outstepping the limits, sinful,</li>
         
         <li>Ignoble, besides all that, base-born;</li>
         
         <li>Because he possesses wealth and sons.</li>
         
         <li>When Our communications are recited to him, he says: Stories of those of yore.</li>
         
         <li>We will brand him on the nose.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We will try them as We tried the owners of the garden, when they swore that
            they would certainly cut off the produce in the morning,
         </li>
         
         <li>And were not willing to set aside a portion (for the poor).</li>
         
         <li>Then there encompassed it a visitation from your Lord while they were sleeping.</li>
         
         <li>So it became as black, barren land.</li>
         
         <li>And they called out to each other in the morning,</li>
         
         <li>Saying: Go early to your tilth if you would cut (the produce).</li>
         
         <li>So they went, while they consulted together secretly,</li>
         
         <li>Saying: No poor man shall enter it today upon you.</li>
         
         <li>And in the morning they went, having the power to prevent.</li>
         
         <li>But when they saw it, they said: Most surely we have gone astray.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! we are made to suffer privation.</li>
         
         <li>The best of them said: Did I not say to you, Why do you not glorify (Allah)?</li>
         
         <li>They said: Glory be to our Lord, surely we were unjust.</li>
         
         <li>Then some of them advanced against others, blaming each other.</li>
         
         <li>Said they: O woe to us! surely we were inordinate:</li>
         
         <li>Maybe, our Lord will give us instead one better than it; surely to our Lord do we
            make our humble petition.
         </li>
         
         <li>Such is the chastisement, and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is greater,
            did they but know!
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely those who guard (against evil) shall have with their Lord gardens of
            bliss.
         </li>
         
         <li>What! shall We then make (i.e. treat) those who submit as the guilty?</li>
         
         <li>What has happened to you? How do you judge?</li>
         
         <li>Or have you a book wherein you read,</li>
         
         <li>That you have surely therein what you choose?</li>
         
         <li>Or have you received from Us an agreement confirmed by an oath extending to the day
            of resurrection that you shall surely have what you demand?
         </li>
         
         <li>Ask them which of them will vouch for that,</li>
         
         <li>Or have they associates if they are truthful.</li>
         
         <li>On the day when there shall be a severe affliction, and they shall be called upon
            to
            make obeisance, but they shall not be able,
         </li>
         
         <li>Their looks cast down, abasement shall overtake them; and they were called upon to
            make obeisance indeed while yet they were safe.
         </li>
         
         <li>So leave Me and him who rejects this announcement; We will overtake them by degrees,
            from whence they perceive not:
         </li>
         
         <li>And I do bear with them, surely My plan is firm.</li>
         
         <li>Or do you ask from them a reward, so that they are burdened with debt?</li>
         
         <li>Or have they (the knowledge of) the unseen, so that they write (it) down?</li>
         
         <li>So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, and be not like the companion of
            the
            fish, when he cried while he was in distress.
         </li>
         
         <li>Were it not that favor from his Lord had overtaken him, he would certainly have been
            cast down upon the naked Found while he was blamed.
         </li>
         
         <li>Then his Lord chose him, and He made him of the good.</li>
         
         <li>And those who disbelieve would almost smite you with their eyes when they hear the
            reminder, and they say: Most surely he is mad.
         </li>
         
         <li>And it is naught but a reminder to the nations.</li>
