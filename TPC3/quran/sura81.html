      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>When the sun is covered,</li>
         
         <li>And when the stars darken,</li>
         
         <li>And when the mountains are made to pass away,</li>
         
         <li>And when the camels are left untended,</li>
         
         <li>And when the wild animals are made to go forth,</li>
         
         <li>And when the seas are set on fire,</li>
         
         <li>And when souls are united,</li>
         
         <li>And when the female infant buried alive is asked</li>
         
         <li>For what sin she was killed,</li>
         
         <li>And when the books are spread,</li>
         
         <li>And when the heaven has its covering removed,</li>
         
         <li>And when the hell is kindled up,</li>
         
         <li>And when the garden is brought nigh,</li>
         
         <li>Every soul shall (then) know what it has prepared.</li>
         
         <li>But nay! I swear by the stars,</li>
         
         <li>That run their course (and) hide themselves,</li>
         
         <li>And the night when it departs,</li>
         
         <li>And the morning when it brightens,</li>
         
         <li>Most surely it is the Word of an honored messenger,</li>
         
         <li>The processor of strength, having an honorable place with the Lord of the
            Dominion,
         </li>
         
         <li>One (to be) obeyed, and faithful in trust.</li>
         
         <li>And your companion is not gone mad.</li>
         
         <li>And of a truth he saw himself on the clear horizon.</li>
         
         <li>Nor of the unseen is he a tenacious concealer.</li>
         
         <li>Nor is it the word of the cursed Shaitan,</li>
         
         <li>Whither then will you go?</li>
         
         <li>It is naught but a reminder for the nations,</li>
         
         <li>For him among you who pleases to go straight.</li>
         
         <li>And you do not please except that Allah please, the Lord of the worlds.</li>
