         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,</li>
         
         <li>Who creates, then makes complete,</li>
         
         <li>And Who makes (things) according to a measure, then guides (them to their goal),</li>
         
         <li>And Who brings forth herbage,</li>
         
         <li>Then makes it dried up, dust-colored.</li>
         
         <li>We will make you recite so you shall not forget,</li>
         
         <li>Except what Allah pleases, surely He knows the manifest, and what is hidden.</li>
         
         <li>And We will make your way smooth to a state of ease.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore do remind, surely reminding does profit.</li>
         
         <li>He who fears will mind,</li>
         
         <li>And the most unfortunate one will avoid it,</li>
         
         <li>Who shall enter the great fire;</li>
         
         <li>Then therein he shall neither live nor die.</li>
         
         <li>He indeed shall be successful who purifies himself,</li>
         
         <li>And magnifies the name of his Lord and prays.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! you prefer the life of this world,</li>
         
         <li>While the hereafter is better and more lasting.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely this is in the earlier scriptures,</li>
         
         <li>The scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa.</li>
