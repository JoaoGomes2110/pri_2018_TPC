      <h2>67. The Kingdom</h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He has power over all things,</li>
         
         <li>Who created death and life that He may try you — which of you is best in deeds;
            and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving,
         </li>
         
         <li>Who created the seven heavens one above another; you see no incongruity in the
            creation of the Beneficent God; then look again, can you see any disorder?
         </li>
         
         <li>Then turn back the eye again and again; your look shall come back to you confused
            while it is fatigued.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We have adorned this lower heaven with ( lamps and We have made these
            missiles for the Shaitans, and We have prepared for them the chastisement of
            burning.
         </li>
         
         <li>And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of hell, and evil is
            the
            resort.
         </li>
         
         <li>When they shall be cast therein, they shall hear a loud moaning of it as it
            heaves,
         </li>
         
         <li>Almost bursting for fury. Whenever a group is cast into it, its keeper shall ask
            them: Did there not come to you a warner?
         </li>
         
         <li>They shall say: Yea! indeed there came to us a warner, but we rejected (him) and
            said: Allah has not revealed anything, you are only in a great error.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they shall say: Had we but listened or pondered, we should not have been among
            the inmates of the burning fire.
         </li>
         
         <li>So they shall acknowledge their sins, but far will be (forgiveness) from the inmates
            of the burning fire.
         </li>
         
         <li>(As for) those who fear their Lord in secret, they shall surely have forgiveness and
            a great reward.
         </li>
         
         <li>And conceal your word or manifest it; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the
            hearts.
         </li>
         
         <li>Does He not know, Who created? And He is the Knower of the subtleties, the Aware.</li>
         
         <li>He it is Who made the earth smooth for you, therefore go about in the spacious sides
            thereof, and eat of His sustenance, and to Him is the return after death.
         </li>
         
         <li>Are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not make the earth to swallow
            you up? Then lo! it shall be in a state of commotion.
         </li>
         
         <li>Or are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not send down upon you a
            punishment? Then shall you know how was My warning.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly those before them rejected (the truth), then how was My
            disapproval.
         </li>
         
         <li>Have they not seen the birds above them expanding (their wings) and contracting
            (them)? What is it that withholds them save the Beneficent God? Surely He sees
            everything.
         </li>
         
         <li>Or who is it that will be a host for you to assist you besides the Beneficent God?
            The unbelievers are only in deception.
         </li>
         
         <li>Or who is it that will give you sustenance if He should withhold His sustenance? Nay!
            they persist in disdain and aversion.
         </li>
         
         <li>What! is he who goes prone upon his face better guided or he who walks upright upon
            a
            straight path?
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the ears and the eyes and
            the hearts: little is it that you give thanks.
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered.</li>
         
         <li>And they say: When shall this threat be (executed) if you are truthful?</li>
         
         <li>Say: The knowledge (thereof) is only with Allah and I am only a plain warner.</li>
         
         <li>But when they shall see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve shall be sorry,
            and it shall be said; This is that which you used to call for.
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: Have you considered if Allah should destroy me and those with me — rather
            He will have mercy on us; yet who will protect the unbelievers from a painful
            punishment?
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: He is the Beneficent God, we believe in Him and on Him do we rely, so you shall
            come to know who it is that is in clear error.
         </li>
         
         <li>Say: Have you considered if your water should go down, who is it then that will bring
            you flowing water?
         </li>
