      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>When the great event comes to pass,</li>
         
         <li>There is no belying its coming to pass — </li>
         
         <li>Abasing (one party), exalting (the other),</li>
         
         <li>When the earth shall be shaken with a (severe) shaking,</li>
         
         <li>And the mountains shall be made to crumble with (an awful) crumbling,</li>
         
         <li>So that they shall be as scattered dust.</li>
         
         <li>And you shall be three sorts.</li>
         
         <li>Then (as to) the companions of the right hand; how happy are the companions of the
            right hand!
         </li>
         
         <li>And (as to) the companions of the left hand; how wretched are the companions of the
            left hand!
         </li>
         
         <li>And the foremost are the foremost,</li>
         
         <li>These are they who are drawn nigh (to Allah),</li>
         
         <li>In the gardens of bliss.</li>
         
         <li>A numerous company from among the first,</li>
         
         <li>And a few from among the latter.</li>
         
         <li>On thrones decorated,</li>
         
         <li>Reclining on them, facing one another.</li>
         
         <li>Round about them shall go youths never altering in age,</li>
         
         <li>With goblets and ewers and a cup of pure drink;</li>
         
         <li>They shall not be affected with headache thereby, nor shall they get exhausted,</li>
         
         <li>And fruits such as they choose,</li>
         
         <li>And the flesh of fowl such as they desire.</li>
         
         <li>And pure, beautiful ones,</li>
         
         <li>The like of the hidden pearls:</li>
         
         <li>A reward for what they used to do.</li>
         
         <li>They shall not hear therein vain or sinful discourse,</li>
         
         <li>Except the word peace, peace.</li>
         
         <li>And the companions of the right hand; how happy are the companions of the right
            hand!
         </li>
         
         <li>Amid thornless lote-trees,</li>
         
         <li>And banana-trees (with fruits), one above another.</li>
         
         <li>And extended shade,</li>
         
         <li>And water flowing constantly,</li>
         
         <li>And abundant fruit,</li>
         
         <li>Neither intercepted nor forbidden,</li>
         
         <li>And exalted thrones.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We have made them to grow into a (new) growth,</li>
         
         <li>Then We have made them virgins,</li>
         
         <li>Loving, equals in age,</li>
         
         <li>For the sake of the companions of the right hand.</li>
         
         <li>A numerous company from among the first,</li>
         
         <li>And a numerous company from among the last.</li>
         
         <li>And those of the left hand, how wretched are those of the left hand!</li>
         
         <li>In hot wind and boiling water,</li>
         
         <li>And the shade of black smoke,</li>
         
         <li>Neither cool nor honorable.</li>
         
         <li>Surely they were before that made to live in ease and plenty.</li>
         
         <li>And they persisted in the great violation.</li>
         
         <li>And they used to say: What! when we die and have become dust and bones, shall we then
            indeed be raised?
         </li>
         
         <li>Or our fathers of yore?</li>
         
         <li>Say: The first and the last,</li>
         
         <li>Shall most surely be gathered together for the appointed hour of a known day.</li>
         
         <li>Then shall you, O you who err and call it a lie!</li>
         
         <li>Most surely eat of a tree of Zaqqoom,</li>
         
         <li>And fill (your) bellies with it;</li>
         
         <li>Then drink over it of boiling water;</li>
         
         <li>And drink as drinks the thirsty camel.</li>
         
         <li>This is their entertainment on the day of requital.</li>
         
         <li>We have created you, why do you not then assent?</li>
         
         <li>Have you considered the seed?</li>
         
         <li>Is it you that create it or are We the creators?</li>
         
         <li>We have ordained death among you and We are not to be overcome,</li>
         
         <li>In order that We may bring in your place the likes of you and make you grow into what
            you know not.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly you know the first growth, why do you not then mind?</li>
         
         <li>Have you considered what you sow?</li>
         
         <li>Is it you that cause it to grow, or are We the causers of growth?</li>
         
         <li>If We pleased, We should have certainly made it broken down into pieces, then would
            you begin to lament:
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely we are burdened with debt:</li>
         
         <li>Nay! we are deprived.</li>
         
         <li>Have you considered the water which you drink?</li>
         
         <li>Is it you that send it down from the clouds, or are We the senders?</li>
         
         <li>If We pleased, We would have made it salty; why do you not then give thanks?</li>
         
         <li>Have you considered the fire which you strike?</li>
         
         <li>Is it you that produce the trees for it, or are We the producers?</li>
         
         <li>We have made it a reminder and an advantage for the wayfarers of the desert.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.</li>
         
         <li>But nay! I swear by the falling of stars;</li>
         
         <li>And most surely it is a very great oath if you only knew;</li>
         
         <li>Most surely it is an honored Quran,</li>
         
         <li>In a book that is protected;</li>
         
         <li>None shall touch it save the purified ones.</li>
         
         <li>A revelation by the Lord of the worlds.</li>
         
         <li>Do you then hold this announcement in contempt?</li>
         
         <li>And to give (it) the lie you make your means of subsistence.</li>
         
         <li>Why is it not then that when it (soul) comes up to the throat,</li>
         
         <li>And you at that time look on — </li>
         
         <li>And We are nearer to it than you, but you do not see — </li>
         
         <li>Then why is it not — if you are not held under authority — </li>
         
         <li>That you send it (not) back — if you are truthful?</li>
         
         <li>Then if he is one of those drawn nigh (to Allah),</li>
         
         <li>Then happiness and bounty and a garden of bliss.</li>
         
         <li>And if he is one of those on the right hand,</li>
         
         <li>Then peace to you from those on the right hand.</li>
         
         <li>And if he is one of the rejecters, the erring ones,</li>
         
         <li>He shall have an entertainment of boiling water,</li>
         
         <li>And burning in hell.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely this is a certain truth.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.</li>
