         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>Has not there come to you the news of the overwhelming calamity?</li>
         
         <li>(Some) faces on that day shall be downcast,</li>
         
         <li>Laboring, toiling,</li>
         
         <li>Entering into burning fire,</li>
         
         <li>Made to drink from a boiling spring.</li>
         
         <li>They shall have no food but of thorns,</li>
         
         <li>Which will neither fatten nor avail against hunger.</li>
         
         <li>(Other) faces on that day shall be happy,</li>
         
         <li>Well-pleased because of their striving,</li>
         
         <li>In a lofty garden,</li>
         
         <li>Wherein you shall not hear vain talk.</li>
         
         <li>Therein is a fountain flowing,</li>
         
         <li>Therein are thrones raised high,</li>
         
         <li>And drinking-cups ready placed,</li>
         
         <li>And cushions set in a row,</li>
         
         <li>And carpets spread out.</li>
         
         <li>Will they not then consider the camels, how they are created?</li>
         
         <li>And the heaven, how it is reared aloft,</li>
         
         <li>And the mountains, how they are firmly fixed,</li>
         
         <li>And the earth, how it is made a vast expanse?</li>
         
         <li>Therefore do remind, for you are only a reminder.</li>
         
         <li>You are not a watcher over them;</li>
         
         <li>But whoever turns back and disbelieves,</li>
         
         <li>Allah will chastise him with the greatest chastisement.</li>
         
         <li>Surely to Us is their turning back,</li>
         
         <li>Then surely upon Us is the taking of their account.</li>
