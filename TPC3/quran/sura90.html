      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>Nay! I swear by this city.</li>
         
         <li>And you shall be made free from obligation in this city — </li>
         
         <li>And the begetter and whom he begot.</li>
         
         <li>Certainly We have created man to be in distress.</li>
         
         <li>Does he think that no one has power over him?</li>
         
         <li>He shall say: I have wasted much wealth.</li>
         
         <li>Does he think that no one sees him?</li>
         
         <li>Have We not given him two eyes,</li>
         
         <li>And a tongue and two lips,</li>
         
         <li>And pointed out to him the two conspicuous ways?</li>
         
         <li>But he would not attempt the uphill road,</li>
         
         <li>And what will make you comprehend what the uphill road is?</li>
         
         <li>(It is) the setting free of a slave,</li>
         
         <li>Or the giving of food in a day of hunger</li>
         
         <li>To an orphan, having relationship,</li>
         
         <li>Or to the poor man lying in the dust.</li>
         
         <li>Then he is of those who believe and charge one another to show patience, and charge
            one another to show compassion.
         </li>
         
         <li>These are the people of the right hand.</li>
         
         <li>And (as for) those who disbelieve in our communications, they are the people of the
            left hand.
         </li>
         
         <li>On them is fire closed over.</li>
