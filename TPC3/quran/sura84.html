         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>When the heaven bursts asunder,</li>
         
         <li>And obeys its Lord and it must.</li>
         
         <li>And when the earth is stretched,</li>
         
         <li>And casts forth what is in it and becomes empty,</li>
         
         <li>And obeys its Lord and it must.</li>
         
         <li>O man! surely you must strive (to attain) to your Lord, a hard striving until you
            meet Him.
         </li>
         
         <li>Then as to him who is given his book in his right hand,</li>
         
         <li>He shall be reckoned with by an easy reckoning,</li>
         
         <li>And he shall go back to his people joyful.</li>
         
         <li>And as to him who is given his book behind his back,</li>
         
         <li>He shall call for perdition,</li>
         
         <li>And enter into burning fire.</li>
         
         <li>Surely he was (erstwhile) joyful among his followers.</li>
         
         <li>Surely he thought that he would never return.</li>
         
         <li>Yea! surely his Lord does ever see him.</li>
         
         <li>But nay! I swear by the sunset redness,</li>
         
         <li>And the night and that which it drives on,</li>
         
         <li>And the moon when it grows full,</li>
         
         <li>That you shall most certainly enter one state after another.</li>
         
         <li>But what is the matter with them that they do not believe,</li>
         
         <li>And when the Quran is recited to them they do not make obeisance?</li>
         
         <li>Nay! those who disbelieve give the lie to the truth.</li>
         
         <li>And Allah knows best what they hide,</li>
         
         <li>So announce to them a painful punishment,</li>
         
         <li>Except those who believe and do good; for them is a reward that shall never be cut
            off.
         </li>
