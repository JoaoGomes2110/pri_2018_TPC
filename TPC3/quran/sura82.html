      <h2>82. The Cleaving Asunder</h2>

      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>When the heaven becomes cleft asunder,</li>
         
         <li>And when the stars become dispersed,</li>
         
         <li>And when the seas are made to flow forth,</li>
         
         <li>And when the graves are laid open,</li>
         
         <li>Every soul shall know what it has sent before and held back.</li>
         
         <li>O man! what has beguiled you from your Lord, the Gracious one,</li>
         
         <li>Who created you, then made you complete, then made you symmetrical?</li>
         
         <li>Into whatever form He pleased He constituted you.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! but you give the lie to the judgment day,</li>
         
         <li>And most surely there are keepers over you,</li>
         
         <li>Honorable recorders,</li>
         
         <li>They know what you do.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely the righteous are in bliss,</li>
         
         <li>And most surely the wicked are in burning fire,</li>
         
         <li>They shall enter it on the day of judgment.</li>
         
         <li>And they shall by no means be absent from it.</li>
         
         <li>And what will make you realize what the day of judgement is?</li>
         
         <li>Again, what will make you realize what the day of judgment Is?</li>
         
         <li>The day on which no soul shall control anything for (another) soul; and the command
            on that day shall be entirely Allah's.
         </li>
