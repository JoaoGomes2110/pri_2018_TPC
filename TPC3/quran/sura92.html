      <h2>92. The Night</h2>

      <ul>
         
         
         <b>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </b>
         
         <li>I swear by the night when it draws a veil,</li>
         
         <li>And the day when it shines in brightness,</li>
         
         <li>And the creating of the male and the female,</li>
         
         <li>Your striving is most surely (directed to) various (ends).</li>
         
         <li>Then as for him who gives away and guards (against evil),</li>
         
         <li>And accepts the best,</li>
         
         <li>We will facilitate for him the easy end.</li>
         
         <li>And as for him who is niggardly and considers himself free from need (of Allah),</li>
         
         <li>And rejects the best,</li>
         
         <li>We will facilitate for him the difficult end.</li>
         
         <li>And his wealth will not avail him when he perishes.</li>
         
         <li>Surely Ours is it to show the way,</li>
         
         <li>And most surely Ours is the hereafter and the former.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore I warn you of the fire that flames:</li>
         
         <li>None shall enter it but the most unhappy,</li>
         
         <li>Who gives the lie (to the truth) and turns (his) back.</li>
         
         <li>And away from it shall be kept the one who guards most (against evil),</li>
         
         <li>Who gives away his wealth, purifying himself.</li>
         
         <li>And no one has with him any boon for which he should be rewarded,</li>
         
         <li>Except the seeking of the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High.</li>
         
         <li>And he shall soon be well-pleased.</li>
         
      </ul>
